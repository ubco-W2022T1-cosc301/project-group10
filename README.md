## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data set was provided by FiveThirtyEight and is a forecast of the 2021-2022 NHL season. While they have a data set with every game since the inaugural season in 1917-1918, we chose last year’s data as it would have both predicted and actualy outcomes of games. The data set gives each team a rating and tries to predict the outcome of the rest of the season based on thousands of simulated games. Throughout the season with each actual game played, the ratings of each team are updated and the simulation process is repeated. It is hard to know FiveThirtyEight’s purpose of the data set, but they have prediction models for almost every sport that are all very reputable. The data set only requires the scores of each game and if they went into overtime/shootout to calculate the ratings. A little fun fact, NHL data is collected by a team of “scorers” at each stadium who keep track of every possible game time stat.
